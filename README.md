# Voice Typing Assistant
--------------
**A fork of https://github.com/Elevate-Code/better-voice-typing**
The intention was to make this fork private... **Stay with the original by dimitri-vs**. This one experiments with some minor tweaks - like starting and stopping the recording with a click on the mouse wheel, no capital letter and no period if fewer than X words etc...
--------------

A lightweight Python desktop app for Windows that improves upon Windows Voice Typing (Win+H) by offering superior transcription accuracy and the ability to navigate between windows while recording, all while maintaining a simple, intuitive interface.

![Voice Typing Demo](voice-typing-demo.gif)

## Overview - How it works

- Press `Caps Lock` to begin recording your voice
- A recording indicator with audio level appears (top-right corner by default)
- You can continue to navigate and type while recording, or click the recording indicator to cancel
- Press `Caps Lock` again to stop recording and process the audio
- The audio is sent to your chosen speech-to-text provider (OpenAI `gpt-4o-transcribe` by default)
- (optional) The transcribed text can be further refined with a quick pass of an LLM model
- The transcribed text is inserted at your current cursor position in any text field or editor

**NOTE:** Hold `Ctrl` while pressing `Caps Lock` if you want to toggle Caps Lock on/off.

## Changelog

See the [CHANGELOG.json](CHANGELOG.json) file for latest changes or the [releases page](https://github.com/Elevate-Code/better-voice-typing/releases) for major releases.

## Features

#### Recording Controls
- **Toggle Recording**: Caps Lock (Ctrl+Caps Lock to toggle Caps Lock on/off)
- **Cancel Recording/Processing**: Click the recording indicator to cancel recording or transcription
- **Copy Last Transcription**: If your cursor was misplaced, left-click tray icon to copy last transcription

### Tray Options/Settings
- Retry Last Transcription: Attempts to re-process the last audio recording, useful if the first attempt failed or was inaccurate.
- Recent Transcriptions: Access previous transcriptions, copy to clipboard.
- Microphone Selection: Choose your preferred input device.
- Settings:
  - Continuous Capture: Default recording mode. Record audio until the user stops it, send it all at once to the STT provider.
  - Clean Transcription: Enable/disable further refinement of the transcription using a configurable LLM.
  - Silent-Start Timeout: Cancels the recording if no sound is detected within the first few seconds, preventing accidental recordings.
  - Recording Indicator: Customize the on-screen size and position of the recording indicator.
  - Speech-to-Text: Select your STT provider (OpenAI, Google Cloud) and model (Whisper, GPT-4o, GPT-4o Mini).
- Restart: Quickly restart the application, like when it's not responding to the keyboard shortcut.

### Tray History
- Keeps track of recent transcriptions
- Useful if your cursor was in the wrong place at the time of insertion
- Quick access to copy previous transcriptions from system tray

### Fine-Tuning (Optional)

While most settings can be controlled from the tray menu, you can fine-tune the application's behavior by editing the `settings.json` file.

| Setting | Description | Default | Example Values |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `silent_start_timeout` | Duration in seconds to wait for sound at the beginning of a recording before automatically canceling. Set to `null` to disable. | `4.0` | `2.0` to `5.0` |
| `silence_threshold` | The audio level (RMS) below which sound is considered silence. Lower values are more sensitive. | `0.01` | `0.005` (very quiet) to `0.02` (noisier) |
| `log_retention_days` | Number of days to keep log files. | `60` | `14`, `90`, `null` (indefinitely) |
| `stt_provider` | The speech-to-text service to use. | `"openai"` | `"openai"`, `"google"` |
| `openai_stt_model` | The specific model to use for OpenAI's service. `gpt-4o-transcribe` is recommended for highest accuracy. | `"gpt-4o-transcribe"` | `"gpt-4o-transcribe"`, `"gpt-4o-mini-transcribe"` |

## Technical Details
- Minimal UI built with Python tkinter
- Multi-provider Speech-to-Text support with OpenAI GPT-4o models and Whisper
- Extensible architecture for adding new STT providers (Google Cloud, Azure, etc.)

## Known Issues/Limitations
- For now, only supporting Windows OS and Python 3.10 - 3.12
- When using `gpt-4o-transcribe`, the end of a transcription may occasionally be cut off - this is a [known model issue](https://community.openai.com/t/
gpt-4o-transcribe-truncates-the-transcript/1148347). A workaround is in place to minimize this, but if it occurs, use the Retry Last Transcription and see the [Troubleshooting Guide](TROUBLESHOOTING.md).
- When using the `gpt-4o-transcribe` model to transcribe spoken instructions, sometimes it responds to them or carries them out.
- Untested update mechanism ([let me know if it doesn't work](https://github.com/jason-m-hicks/better-voice-typing/issues))
- Recordings may not produce transcriptions if your microphone's audio level is too low
- Maximum recording duration of ~10 minutes per transcription due to OpenAI Whisper API's 25MB file size limit

## Troubleshooting

For solutions to common problems, see the [**Troubleshooting Guide**](TROUBLESHOOTING.md).
